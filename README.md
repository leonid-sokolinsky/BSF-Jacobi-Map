# BSF-Jacobi-Map
Parallel implementation of Jacobi method using the higher-order functions Map

This repository contains source codes of a parallel implementation of the iterative Jacobi method for solving systems of linear algebraic equations on computing clusters. The solution is built using the BSF-skeleton in C++. The source codes of the BSF-skeleton with a user manual are available at https://github.com/leonid-sokolinsky/BSF-skeleton.

A description of this parallel implementation is available in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04276.
